		  CUBA</head> 
		<p> In 1904, Joseph E. Hubbard was sent to Cuba to assist in establishing
		  a YMCA. The Cuban Y was founded on May 12, 1905 in Havana. This Association
		  served both Americans and Cubans. A building was rented, a gymnasium was
		  opened, Bible classes were held, a boys' camp was facilitated, and Cubans were
		  added to the board of directors. </p> 
		<p>Havana had difficulties raising money early on. In 1911, an effort was
		  made, encouraged by a conditional offer of $75,000 from the YMCA International
		  Committee, to obtain 150,000 in Havana for a new building. The Catholic bishop
		  publicly attacked the project as Protestant, Spanish clubs were opposed,
		  American business men were lukewarm and the campaign fell far from the goal.
		  Hubbard was not discouraged and remained in Havana. In 1915 a building was
		  erected with mostly money from the International Committee. </p> 
		<p>In 1921, Everett James Simonds replaced Hubbard. For a time the Havana
		  Association continued to grow through the financial support of the Cubans.
		  Simonds left in 1926. Cuban Luis Machado was president, but in general, able
		  Cuban leadership was lacking, especially for the secretarial posts. Simonds was
		  replaced by Herbert Watson Chaffee. Unfortunately, arguments about finances and
		  revisions of the constitution arose between the Cubans and the North Americans.
		  The building was in horrible shape and debts were accumulated. The depression
		  struck and with it fell the economy. And for all of the above reasons the
		  effort in Havana came to an unfortunate end. In 1941 the building was sold.

		  in Cuba, along with their dates of service:</p>
