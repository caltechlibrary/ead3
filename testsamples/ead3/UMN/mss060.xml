		<head>Biographical Sketch for Francis Clinton Shenehon (1861-1939)</head>
		
		<p>Francis Shenehon was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1861. He came to
		  Minneapolis in 1878 and worked on a survey crew for the Soo Line Railroad, then
		  as a member of the firm of Cox &amp; Shenehon (1888-1890), and later as an
		  employee in the U.S. War Department on the construction of New Fort Brady at
		  Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. He studied civil engineering at the University of
		  Minnesota through correspondence courses and graduated in 1895. Following
		  graduation, he was employed on the U.S. Lake Survey of the Great Lakes and a
		  survey of the St. Lawrence River (1898-1909). This included a study of and
		  report on the stabilization and preservation of Niagara Falls. </p> 
		<p>In 1909 Shenehon became Dean of the College of Engineering at the
		  University of Minnesota, a position he held until 1917. From 1917 to 1919 he
		  was a consulting engineer to the Sanitary District of Chicago, then entered
		  partnership with Adolph Meyer in the firm of Shenehon &amp; Meyer in
		  Minneapolis. The partnership was dissolved in 1923, and Shenehon was appointed
		  vice president and general manager of Byllesby Engineering and Management
		  Corporation of Chicago. In 1928 he resumed general engineering practice in
		  Minneapolis. </p> 
		<p>Shenehon married Katherine Byrd Cross in 1891 and they had three
		  daughters: Eleanor Shenehon, Clare Shenehon Boyd, and Katherine ("Casey")
		  Shenehon Child. Shenehon died in Minneapolis on October 3, 1939.</p>
